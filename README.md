# Nicolás Siciliano · Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio built with Astro. It highlights the products, SaaS platforms, and marketing experiences I deliver—from laboratory inventory systems and headless commerce templates to bespoke landing pages for creative studios. The site showcases my approach to full-stack development, product strategy, and data-rich interfaces.

I partner with teams to model complex domains, craft user-centric interfaces, and integrate billing, authentication, and automation flows that scale. My work spans SaaS platforms, headless commerce experiences, and content-rich marketing sites.
