# Samuel Music Tour · Headless Commerce Template

Samuel Music Tour is a template showcase that combines Next.js 13 App Router with Wix Headless APIs to orchestrate a complete ticketing and merchandising experience. Bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, it demonstrates how events and store data can be managed in Wix while rendering a modern, performant React front end.

## Overview

The project highlights the power of decoupling content management from the presentation layer. The Wix Headless SDK fetches and mutates data from Wix Events, Stores, and Redirects, while Next.js handles routing, streaming, and rendering across server and client boundaries.

- **Headless CMS:** Store event schedules, rich descriptions, inventory, and tickets in Wix; query them via the Wix SDK.
- **Next.js App Router:** Server Components statically generate product and event pages with incremental revalidation, while Client Components drive interactivity such as carts, modals, and filters.
- **E-commerce & Ticketing:** Wix Stores and Events APIs deliver product listings, quick-buy flows, ticket availability, schedules, and back-in-stock notifications.
- **Theming & UI:** Tailwind CSS alongside Flowbite supplies responsive, reusable components (gallery, schedule, tables) for consistent presentation.
- **Authentication-ready:** Prebuilt UI elements—login modal, sidebar—prepare the template for member authentication and visitor flows through Wix.

Marketing and content teams keep using familiar Wix dashboards to create products, events, and schedules, while developers deploy a tailored React experience on any Next.js-friendly platform.
